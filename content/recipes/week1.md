Rating:  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I followed the instructions for the most part, with a few personal tweaks—dicing the onions and halving the olives. It took me about 30 minutes to prepare (with help!). I don't love feta cheese, but I had to use it up because SML and I caught "the bad disease" and couldn't take this to a New Year's Eve party. So here we are, getting our feta fix at home as our first of fifty-two new recipes this year.

As for the rating, I gave it 4 stars out of 5. Let's just say that feta cheese and I have a complicated relationship, but in many ways, this was a delightful dish.
